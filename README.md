## 💳 Credit Card Rupay UPI File Download Automation 🚀

### Automating NPCI Portal File Retrieval for Seamless Settlement 🏦 - Saving **31 Man-Hours Per Month!**

This project automated the manual process of downloading Rupay Credit Card UPI transaction settlement files from the NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) portal. The solution saves **31 man-hours per month**, eliminates manual errors, reduces operational risk, and ensures timely and accurate file delivery for downstream settlement processes.

### 🎯 Requirement: Manual, Time-Consuming, and Operationally Risky File Retrieval

The existing process for downloading Rupay UPI settlement files was manual and inefficient:

*   **😓 Manual Portal Login & Navigation:** Users had to manually log in to the NPCI Rupay portal and navigate to the file download section.
*   **⏱️ Time-Consuming Download Process:** Manually selecting date ranges, cycles, and downloading files for each cycle was a repetitive and time-consuming task.
*   **🔒 Manual Decryption:** Downloaded files were often encrypted (PGP format), requiring users to manually launch a PGP decryption tool and decrypt each file.
*   **⚠️ Risk of Manual Errors & Miss-outs:** Manual handling of multiple portals, cycles, and decryption steps was prone to errors and the risk of missing files, leading to potential settlement discrepancies.
*   **🛡️ Operational Risk:** Manual handling of sensitive settlement data presented an operational risk due to potential human error or security vulnerabilities.
*   **⏳ User Dependency:** The process was dependent on manual user intervention and availability, potentially causing delays.

### 🤖 Automation Approach:  Secure, Cycle-Wise, End-to-End File Download Solution

Our automation strategy focused on creating a secure and fully automated file retrieval process:

*   **🌐 NPCI Rupay Portal Web Automation:** 🤖 Bot automates the login process to the **NPCI Rupay portal** and navigates to the file download section using web automation.
*   **📅 Dynamic Date & Cycle Selection:** 🤖 Bot automatically enters the **required date ranges and cycle names** for file download, based on pre-defined schedules or configurations.
*   **📥 Cycle-Wise File Download:** 🤖 Bot systematically downloads **CC Rupay settlement files cycle-wise** as per the designated time slots, ensuring all required files are retrieved.
*   **🔒 Automated PGP Decryption:** 🤖 Bot utilizes **surface automation to interact with a PGP encryption tool** to automatically decrypt downloaded files in .pgp format, eliminating manual decryption steps.
*   **📂 File Unzipping:** 🤖 Bot automatically **unzips downloaded files** (if compressed) to access the settlement data.
*   **📤 SFTP Transfer:** 🤖 Bot automatically **transfers the decrypted settlement files to designated SFTP paths**, making them readily available for downstream settlement systems.
*   **📊 Additional Report Download (Adjustment & DRC):** 🤖 Bot further automates the download of **"Adjustment" and "DRC" reports** (in .xlsx format) from the "Reports" menu of the NPCI portal for Cycle 2, ensuring comprehensive data retrieval.
*   **📧 Cycle-Wise Status Emails:** 🤖 Bot sends out **cycle-wise status emails** upon successful completion of each download and processing cycle, providing timely updates and ensuring process transparency.

### ✨ Role of Automation:  From Manual Hassle to Automated Efficiency and Security

Automation transformed the Rupay UPI file download process from a manual, risky operation into a streamlined, secure, and efficient system:

*   **Elimination of Manual Effort:** 🤖 Bot performs the entire file download, decryption, and transfer process without any manual intervention, removing user dependency and freeing up valuable time.
*   **Reduced Operational Risk:** 🛡️ By automating the handling of sensitive settlement data, the bot significantly minimizes operational risk associated with manual errors and potential data breaches.
*   **Ensured Timeliness & Accuracy:** ⏱️ Automated scheduled downloads ensure timely retrieval of files for settlement processing, while eliminating manual errors guarantees data accuracy.
*   **24/7 Operation:** 🤖 Bot can run 24/7, ensuring file availability regardless of user availability or working hours.
*   **Improved Efficiency & Resource Savings:** 🚀 Automation drastically reduces the time spent on file downloading, allowing resources to be allocated to more value-added activities.
